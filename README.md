# NS2-HealingSoundsMod

Enables the healing cinematic and sound whenever a gorge heals via healspraying a friendly player or a built alien structure, also adds a small construct sound to the player when they're healspraying an unbuilt alien structure

Sounds are silent if player has silence.

Created with the intent for better feedback for the gorge.
